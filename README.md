  - Authenication via 

- **For Administrators:**
  - Publish, update, and remove events
  - Manage registered users

## Technical aspects

 - Frontend: Blazor WASM
 - Backend: .NET 9 minimal API
 - Database: MongoDB
 - Authentication: User credentials are validated by the backend using BCrypt password hashing to securely store and compare passwords. Upon successful login, the server generates a signed JWT containing user identity and claims (such as roles). The token is returned to the client and included in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

 - Authorization:  Access control is enforced using the role claim embedded in the JWT. ASP.NET Coreâ€™s [Authorize] attribute and policy-based authorization check the role claim to determine if the authenticated user has permission to access a given endpoint or Blazor component.

## Getting Started

**To configure your connection string:**
In the EventManager.Api project:

1. Create a new file named 'appsettings.Development.json' if it doesn't exist.
2. Add your MongoDB connection string to this file using the following format:
   {
     "MongoDbSettings": {
       "ConnectionString": "your_mongodb_connection_string_here",
       "DatabaseName": "EventManager"
     }
   }
3. Replace 'your_mongodb_connection_string_here' with your actual MongoDB connection string.
4. Ensure this file is not tracked by Git to keep your connection string private.
